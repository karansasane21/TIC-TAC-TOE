# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Features

- 2-player functionality: Players can take turns entering their moves.
- Dynamic board display: The game board is displayed in the console after each move.
- Win and draw detection: The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- Input validation: Validates player moves to ensure they are within the valid range and on an empty spot.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
